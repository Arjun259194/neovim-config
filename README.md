# Neovim config with Lua

Hey there, my name is Arjun and like many other programmers out there, I use Vim (Neovim) for editing my test. Neovim is a powerful and efficient editor but it is not ready to go out of the box and you have to configure it yourself for yourself.

## What is this repo??

This is my personal Neovim config. I use this config for my Neovim and it is created as per my needs. This config has all the tools and settings/configuration required for a modern code/text editor.
It has features like

1. autocompletion
1. syntax highlighting
1. LSP provide quick fixes and code suggestions
1. Keybindings for fast access
